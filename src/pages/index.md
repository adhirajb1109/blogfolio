I'm Adhiraj and I love crafting unique products to solve real-life problems using the power of code. 

As a high school student, I'm super-excited about this transformative phase of my life, as I have the opportunity to hone my skills and broaden my perspective on the world.

Technology has become food to my insatiable curiosity. I plan to satisfy my inner geek even further unraveling the mysteries of the tech world. 

Beyond my technical pursuits, I'm an die-hard bookworm, diving deep into various domains like philosophy, history, economics, geopolitics, and, of course, technology. Each exploration leads me down a rabbit hole I can't resist.

You can delve into my writings and insights on these subjects right [here](/posts/).

I'm on an exciting journey, transitioning from crafting toy projects to building impactful real-world products. You can explore some of these projects and creations of mine right [here](https://github.com/adhirajb1109/).

One of my recent endeavors revolves around developing a one-of-a-kind social media platform which leverages the power of the tried-and-tested [RSS Protocol](https://wikipedia.com/en/rss/). This means putting the control of your content in your hands, enabling you to curate and enjoy what truly matters to you, without any algorithms trying to sway you away and gradually converting you into a dopamine-addict.

I'm eagerly seeking new part-time opportunities to apply my skills and unleash my full potential. Feel free to take a peek at my [CV](https://read.cv/adhirajb1109) to gain further insight into my capabilities and how I can make a meaningful impact in your startup.
