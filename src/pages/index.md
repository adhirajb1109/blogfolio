Hey ðŸ‘‹, <br />
I'm Adhiraj, a passionate creator who loves crafting unique products to solve real-life problems using the power of code.

I grew up in Delhi but recently moved to Bangalore, where I continue to pursue my interests. Currently in high school, I'm excited about this formative period in my life, as it offers numerous opportunities to refine my skills and gain a broader perspective on the world.

My journey in the world of coding began at the age of 11, and it's like posessing a secret superpower! Technology has become my true love, and I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest bleeding-edge advancements in the tech world.

Beyond my technical interests, I am a die-hard bookworm, nerd or a geek, whatever you may call it. I enjoy deep-diving into various subjects, including philosophy, history, economics, geopolitics, and, of course, technology. Sooner than I realise, each exploration leads me down to a rabbit hole which I can't escape.

**P.S.** You can find my writings and insights on the above topics [here](/posts).

I'm now on this super cool journey from making toy projects to building real-deal products that can make a difference.

One of my latest endeavours involves developing a next-generation social media platform, leveraging the power of the tried-and-tested [RSS Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). <br/>
This means that the users get to have total control over what you see on your feed, no more algorithms telling you what to do!

With our platform, you can be the boss of your content. You decide what you wanna see, without any sneaky algorithms trying to manipulate you. It's all about giving you the power to curate and enjoy content that really matters to you.
