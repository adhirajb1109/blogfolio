Hey!  
I'm Adhiraj and I love crafting unique products to solve real-life problems using the power of code. 

As a high school student, I'm thrilled about this transformative phase of my life, where I have the opportunity to hone my skills and broaden my perspective on the world.

Technology has captivated my inner geek, and I'm driven to unravel the mysteries of this ever-evolving tech realm.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I'm an unapologetic bookworm, diving deep into various domains like philosophy, history, economics, geopolitics, and, of course, technology. Each exploration leads me down a rabbit hole I can't resist.

You can delve into my writings and insights on these subjects right [here](/posts/).

I'm embarking on an exciting journey, transitioning from crafting toy projects to building impactful real-world products. You can explore some of these projects and creations of mine right [here](https://github.com/adhirajb1109/).

One of my recent endeavors revolves around developing a one-of-a-kind social media platform that leverages the power of the tried-and-tested [RSS Protocol](https://wikipedia.com/en/rss/). This means putting you in control of your content in your hands, enabling you to curate and enjoy what truly matters to you, without any sneaky algorithms trying to sway you away and converting you into a dopamine-addict.

I'm eagerly seeking new part-time opportunities to apply my skills and unleash my full potential. Feel free to take a peek at my [CV](https://read.cv/adhirajb1109) to gain further insight into my capabilities and how I can make a meaningful impact in your startup.

I'm super thrilled to connect with new friends, collaborators, and perhaps even co-founders! You can usually find me hanging out on [Twitter](https://tiwtter.com/adhirajb1109/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/876685465183473675/), so don't hesitate to slide into my DMs for a chat.

Oh, and if you prefer the good old-fashioned email route, you can reach me at [hey@adhiraj.xyz](mailto:hey@adhiraj.xyz). I would absolutely love to engage in in-depth conversations on all things geeky with you.
